This site runs on Github Pages using [Jekyll][j]. Originally, the intent was to
use vanilla HTML to build a site resembling clang.llvm.org as much as possible.
Unfortunately, Pages don't support server-side includes, therefore we had to
settle for Jekyll.

Converting default Jekyll site layout from "blog first" to "project first" was
rather simle and painless. We don't know how well this would hold under load
(at the end of the day, Github Pages is not intended for extremely
traffic-heavy sites), but let's hope all works out.
