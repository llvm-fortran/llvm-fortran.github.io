This site runs on Github Pages using [Jekyll][j]. Originally, the intent was to
use vanilla HTML to build a site resembling [clang.llvm.org][c] as much as
possible.  Unfortunately, Pages don't support server-side includes, therefore
we had to settle for Jekyll.

Converting default Jekyll site layout from "blog first" to "project first" was
rather easy. It is hard to know how well the site would hold under load (at the
end of the day, Github Pages is not intended for traffic-heavy sites), but
let's hope all works out.

We don't have a web designer, but we probaby [need one][d].
