llvm-fortran.github.io
======================

Jekyll-based site for the project.

## Changes from stock minima theme

`long_title` field added to page front matter. If present, it overrides the
title of the page and top level heading.

Menu converted to a vertical list on left-hand side.

## To do

Site needs more content!

To improve layout and readability:

- More "LLVM" style (from stylesheet), simplify the page layout
- More structure to the menu - categories
